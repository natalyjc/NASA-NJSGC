## Plan
Title: Predicting Near-Earth Object Potential Hazardous Using Machine Learning and 3D Trajectory Data 

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict if near-Earth objects are potentially hazardous based on their metadata

Binary Classification Model: Extracting is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid from Asteroids - NeoWs API as target variable. Combining metadata from SBDB Close Approach API and NASA API

Data Integration: [NEO Earth Close Approaches Data Table](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/), [SBDB Close-Approach Data API](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/cad.html), [Horizons API](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html#command), [Asteroids NeoWs](https://api.nasa.gov/?search=horizons#browseAPI)

## To-Do
Read through these sources for classification algorithm: [Machine learning techniques for classifying dangerous asteroids](https://methods-x.com/article/S2215-0161(23)00334-5/fulltext), [Classification and Comparative Analysis of Earth's Nearest Objects using Machine Learning Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10112391) 
Use large dataset of 31 columns and 15,355 near-earth objects ranging from Jan 1, 2004 to June 1, 2024 to predict potentially hazardous objects
